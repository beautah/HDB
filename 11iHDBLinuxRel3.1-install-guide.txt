The purpose of this document is to guide HDB users
in the creation of a new HDB database.  The intent of this
document is to be brief, with the core of the instructions to 
be either WEB accessible or in "readme.txt" files in the doc 
directory of the installation.

NOTE:  To successfully begin the installation of HDB you 
must have acquired this file, 11iHDBLinuxRel3.1/install-guide.txt, 
along with two other files: 
1. 11iHDBLinuxRel3.1-install  -- this is the HDB2 installation script   
2. 11iHDBLinuxRel3.1-tar      -- contains programs, scripts, etc... 

Note that, in the remainder of this document, RELEASE 
refers to the directory 11iHDBLinuxRel3.1 where the release
files get extracted by the installation script.

1. Decide in what directory you want the release and then
   execute the installation script where you will enter your 
   desired release directory.  You may have to make this file 
   executeable by doing a: chmod +x 11iHDBLinuxRel3.1-install 

   ./11iHDBLinuxRel3.1-install

2. Create the HDB database

C:\> set ORACLE_HOME=C:\oracle\app\product\10.2.0
C:\> echo %ORACLE_HOME%


mkdir -p /home/app/oracle/product/11.2.0.4/db_1
chown -R oracle:oinstall /home/app
chmod -R 775 /home/app

imp system file=/home/app/oracle/admin/hdb31/dpdump/hdb31.dmp fromuser=HDBDBA touser=HDBDBA

VBoxManage modifyhd "C:\Users\Ozdemir\VirtualBox VMs\oracle7\oracle7.vdi" --resize 40000

set HDB_LOCAL=hdbt31
set ORACLE_SID=hdbt31
set ORACLE_HOME=/home/app/oracle/product/11.2.0.4/db_1
set ORACLE_BASE=/home/app/oracle
set LD_LIBRARY_PATH=%ORACLE_HOME%/lib
set PATH "$PATH":"$ORACLE_HOME"/bin





   See RELEASE/doc/linux_install.pdf OR
   the HDB Users' Web page, Database,
   Install Guide, for instructions
   on installing HDB.

3. Install the Meta Data Application

   See RELEASE/doc/meta_data_installation.pdf OR
   the HDB Users' Web page, Meta Data Application,
   Meta Data Application Installation Guide.

4. If applicable, install The Water Accounting Application database objects
   set you default directory to the "release directory"/wateraccounting
   log on to an sqlplus session either as sys, a dba, or the dba that currently owns the HDB tables (Preferred method), 
   execute the sql command : @create_wa "HDB dba that owns all the tables"    example: @create_wa uchdba
   exit the sql session andeck th e.out files for any obvious errors.  a unix command: grep ERROR *.out should suffice  


5  Edit the .cshrc_hdb_app file

   See RELEASE/doc/cshrc_hdb_app_readme.txt for
   instructions.  And make sure you source it so that your
   environment variable take effect.

7. Import site Specific Data

   If you do not have a prior version of HDB or you want 
   to start this database with no previously entered
   metadata, then skip this step.

   However if you have site specific data or Metadata
   in a previous version of HDB then you need
   to import this data into the newly created HDB2.

   To do the data export and the import set your default
   to RELEASE/oracle_script/site_data and
   see RELEASE/doc/site_data_readme.txt for instructions

8. Set up cron jobs for Data Loaders

   Your Installation will probably want to use cron jobs to load
   your Hydromet data.

   see RELEASE/doc/data_loaders_readme.txt for instructions

9. Site-specific applications

   Sutron-maintained library source and object code is included in
   the release for sites that use this code in their site_specific
   applications. These include the following:
      
   Environ file
   hdbLib directory
   utilsLib directory
   lib directory
   include directory
