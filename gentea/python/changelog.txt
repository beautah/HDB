TECHNICAL CHANGELOG

0.1.9   2013/04/24
    Fill labels:
        Added comma-delimited thousands
        Added units ('ac.ft.')
        Added spaces around the '/'
        Changed underlying drawing mechanism to draw background underneath without slicing other text

    Config File:
        Added support for single dynamic teacup-sizing function
        Added point-sizing config option
        Added point-color config option
        Added line-color config option
        Added font-size and font-face options to the config file

0.1.14  2013/04/25
    Config File:
        Added support for different indicator-line widths
        Added timestamp location parameter

    Teacups:
        Changed outlines from blue to black.
            Also considered increasing line width, but decided against this due to visual concerns.
        Changed units from "ac.ft." to "acft."
        Replaced "Full" with "full"

    Added a crude position tester to the main method of drawing.py. This can be used to import a config file and view sample output from it immediately, without hitting a database or using any real data. Useful for quickly fine-tuning attribute placement.
