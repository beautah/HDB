This should be installed under your HDB root directory.

This directory should contain the files
INSTALL
checkapps.pl
hdbprocs

The library requirements for this tool are similar to the usgs2hdb.pl data
loader. If this is running on the system, no other library changes should be
necessary. If you are not running the usgs2hdb.pl loader, you will need the
following Perl Libraries:
DBI, DBD-Oracle, Hdb.

Hdb.pm is available from Andrew Gilmore <agilmore@uc.usbr.gov>.

To allow this tool, and other hdb tools that use this same method of logging
in, create a file in the dba user's unix home directory named .app_user_login,
containing the three lines (corrected for your database):
username app_user
password hdb2
database hdb2

Fix permissions so no other users can read this file:
chmod og-rwx .app_user_login

Then configure the application:

Edit hdbprocs, and change the value of HDB_ENV to point to the root directory
of your HDB installation (i.e. the directory containing bin, oracle_script,
etc...) Change the value of HDB_DBA to the unix username of the HDB DBA
account, eg uchdba 

In the database, each routing spec and computation process that should be
started automatically should have a property named autostart with a value of Y.
This can be set in the Decodes Editor GUI for routing specs, and in the
Computation Editor GUI for computations.

Run the script:
hdbprocs start to start the applications,
hdbprocs stop to stop them,
hdbprocs reload to stop and start and
hdbprocs status to find if they are running or not

To make the system always start up the indicated processes,
make a copy of this file in the system startup directories. 
This will require root priviledges:
cp hdbprocs /etc/init.d

For Solaris:
also make links to the correct startup and shutdown directories:
ln -s /etc/init.d/hdbprocs /etc/rc3.d/S99hdbprocs
ln -s /etc/init.d/hdbprocs /etc/rc1.d/K01hdbprocs
ln -s /etc/init.d/hdbprocs /etc/rc0.d/K01hdbprocs
ln -s /etc/init.d/hdbprocs /etc/rcS.d/K01hdbprocs

For Red Hat Enterprise Linux, running
'chkconfig --add hdbprocs
should be enough.
