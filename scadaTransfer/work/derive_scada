# huge list of SDIs is all the sdis that are loaded by scadaTransfer
# that have derivations that start with hourly data.
# This list was generated by the query:
# select distinct a.site_datatype_id from r_base a,
# ref_derivation_source b where loading_application_id = 10 and
# start_date_time > sysdate -2 and a.site_datatype_id = b.site_datatype_id
# and b.interval = 'hour';
# there are 42 total that are loaded, but only 39 have derivation
# specifications with a source of 'hour'
# exceptions are morrow point total and power release
# also ignore GC total release, since that is calculated from AVM
# and changed GC power release to GC power plant scada release
